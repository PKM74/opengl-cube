## What does it Do?
Spin a cube... (it also rapidly speeds up, need to fix that but as per expected i do not care.)
## Why did i make this..?
i was bored and wanted to screw with OpenGL and C? (i made this at like 2am ok?)
## What possible use could this have...
A project to learn from, or build off of, also great for making sure your system is setup correctly...
## Why did i use GLUT over GLFW
I already knew how to use GLUT, have not bothered with GLFW plus its impossible to find any
Resources for GLFW and C, all of them use C++ (im sure theres something, im just lazy and really don't care...)
## Why C?
It the programming language im the best in, by far? (why else...)
